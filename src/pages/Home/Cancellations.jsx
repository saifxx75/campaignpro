          At CampaignPro, we aim to provide seamless campaign management
          solutions for our users. We understand that sometimes circumstances
          change, and you may need to cancel your subscription. If you wish to
          cancel, you can easily do so through your account settings. Once you
          cancel, your subscription will remain active until the end of the
          current billing cycle, after which you will no longer have access to
          premium features.
        </p>
        <h4>Cancellation Terms</h4>
        <p>
          Please note that once a subscription is canceled, we do not offer
          prorated refunds for the unused portion of your subscription period.
          You will, however, continue to have access to the service until the
          current billing cycle ends. For any service upgrades or downgrades
          during the subscription period, the changes will take effect
          immediately, but no partial refunds will be issued for the previous
          subscription level.
        </p>
        <h4>Refund Eligibility</h4>
        <p>
          Refunds will only be considered under special circumstances, such as
          technical failures or billing errors on our part. Refund requests must
          be submitted within 14 days of the initial purchase or billing date.
          If you believe you have been charged incorrectly or experience
          technical issues, please contact our support team. We will evaluate
          your request on a case-by-case basis and work diligently to resolve
          your concerns in a timely manner.
        </p>
        <h4>No Refund for Inactivity</h4>
        <p>
          We do not provide refunds for accounts that have been inactive or
          unused during the subscription period. It is the responsibility of the
          user to cancel their subscription if they no longer wish to use
          CampaignPro. We encourage users to manage their subscriptions to avoid
          unwanted renewals or charges.
        </p>
